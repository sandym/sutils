# sutils
A collection of very random C++ utilities I used over the years. Some might
even be good and work as advertised!

This is mostly a re-write with modern c++ in mind for my own use. Most parts
need some C++17 support from the compiler. It's not really a 'library', just add
src to your header search path and add the .cpp you need, no config should be
required.
