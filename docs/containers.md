## `su_flat_map.h`

Drop in replacement for std::map, but use std::vector as
storage. Warning: iterators are vector's iterators.

```C++
su::flat_map<std::string,int> m;
```

## `su_flat_set.h`

Drop in replacement for std::set, but use std::vector as
storage. Warning: iterators are vector's iterators.

```C++
su::flat_set<std::string> m;
```

## `su_map.h`

Some map utilities, extract a value from a const map, extract all keys from a map, get a key for a given value, etc.

## `su_small_vector.h`

**Incomplete**
